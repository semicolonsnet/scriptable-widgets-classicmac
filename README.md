# scriptable-widgets-classicmac
 A set of Scriptable widgets to go with my classic Mac #aesthetic

- Calendar Widget - based on [rudotriton](https://github.com/rudotriton/scriptable-calendar-widget)'s widget"
- Deliveries widget - based on rudotriton's widget, but focusing just on the content in a calendar called "Deliveries". Works with Deliveries.app's function to export to a calendar.
- Weather widget - based on [supermamon](https://github.com/supermamon/scriptable-scripts/blob/master/openweathermap/simple-weather-widget.js)'s widget.
